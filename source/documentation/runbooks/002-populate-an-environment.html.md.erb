## Setup metadata ingestion

Checkout [data-catalogue-metadata](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/data-catalogue-metadata) (internal repo) and follow the instructions in that repo:

- Setup the Dathaub CLI
- Run ingestions handled by the python script
- Run one-off command line ingestions
- Setup scheduled ingestion recipes in Datahub

### Scheduled ingestion checklist

You should have the following ingestions scheduled to run from Datahub itself:

- DBT

### Entity checklist

After populating an environment you should expect to see the following entities in Datahub:

- Glossary groups and terms
- Domains
- Users
- Datasets (tables from Analytical platforms and create-a-derived-table)
- Containers (databases from Analytical platform and create-a-derived-table)
- Data Products
- Charts (from Justice Data)

Datasets, Containers, Data Products and Charts should link to relevant owners, domains, and tags.

## Other manual tasks
Certain aspects of the environment setup are not scripted:

- Setting a warning notice on the datahub homepage
- Creating custom views in datahub, e.g. "Well documented data"

These must be set up manually when recreating an environment.

Views can be created from the "manage views" interface.

We currently have one view, "Well documented"

This should be public with the following filters:

- Entity type is any of (Datasets, Data Products, Containers, Charts, Domains)
- Tag is not "needsDocumentation"
