## General Information

- Our team have a stand up each morning at 10:45.
- We plan our sprints using GitHub Projects.
- We have our team Retrospective every 2 weeks at the end of each sprint.

## Tools

### Communication

Our main chat platform is Slack, and this is our preferred method of communication.

We use Slack huddles in the [#data-catalogue channel](https://moj.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C03QZ776JVA)
for pairing or direct calls.

Developers link PR requests in the [#dpl-developers channel](https://moj.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C05AABSKFLJ)

Our agile ceremonies take place in Google Meet,
making use of Miro boards for collecting feedback from the team,
or looking at the [team github projects board](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/projects/57/views/6) for planning.

Our main Slack channels are:

#### #data-catalogue

The [#data-catalogue](https://moj.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C04M8224WCV) channel is our team channel,
where we have discussions about anything ranging from:

- in-depth technical issues
- questions or discussions around the service
- to request someone else from the team's help
- when we're away for lunch or some other appointment
- general musings

If you can't make standup, post your standup update here.

### GitHub

Access to Data Catalogue's GitHub repositories and projects is managed in Terraform.

To add a user to a team, add their GitHub username to the data-catalogue team in the
[`data-catalogue.tf`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/data-platform/blob/main/terraform/github/data-catalogue.tf) configuration.
